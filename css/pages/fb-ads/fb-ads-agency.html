            Besides possessing confidence in our system that enables us to offer $500 to companies accounts who we
            cannot improve,
            there are some mechanic differentials in how we buy media.

            No matter the platform we are buying media on, we start with a customer avatar process that is extremely

          <p class="regular-text mb-35">
            Most teams build avatars primarily on demographics and some savvy marketers look at psychographics or actual
            search
            behavior. We do those things but also build client empathy maps to ensure congruent messaging, offers, and
            content is
            delivered to the right person at just the right time.
