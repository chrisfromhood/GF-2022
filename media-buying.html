            We developed a system that became part of our Growth Foundry Framework which allows us to consistently drive
            an ROI from
            our ad management endeavors. Managing tens of millions of dollars in ad spend has granted us the ability to
            cut our
            teeth on scaling profitable campaigns in the trenches and gather empirical data on what really works

            We do a few things different from other ad buyers

            Besides possessing confidence in our system that enables us to offer $500 to companies accounts who we
            cannot improve,
            there are some mechanic differentials in how we buy media.
          </p>
          <p class="regular-text mb-35">
            No matter the platform we are buying media on, we start with a customer avatar process that is extremely
            unique to
            Growth Foundry.
          </p>
          <p class="regular-text mb-35">
            Most teams build avatars primarily on demographics and some savvy marketers look at psychographics or actual
            search
            behavior. We do those things but also build client empathy maps to ensure congruent messaging, offers, and
            content is
            delivered to the right person at just the right time.
          </p>
          <p class="regular-text mb-35">
            Our onboarding process consists of a full media planning ecosystem being created complete with interviews
            with your
            clients/customers and a deep dive into your current product, offerings, and content.
          </p>
          <p class="regular-text mb-35">
            An A-Z inventory of what marketing assets you possess and what you will need is developed. This plan is
            created with
            your team, our content marketing specialists, designers, and media buyers.
